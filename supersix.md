Designed for two people.

Each round is 6 minutes.

Each person does 1 minute on the pads and one minute pyramid punches of either straights or Uppercuts shadow boxing. The pad work will alternate between combinations, pyramids and leg ladders. The shadow boxing should ideally be pyramids. 

This is not a rest!

After 6 minutes there is a 30 second break.

That is a rest!

This session is intended as a six by six minute  or three by six minute workout depending upon fitness levels.
