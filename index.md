garybuckle is just like you. He runs the odd marathon, plays a bit of squash, does 20 press ups everyday, eats too much chocolate and dreams of being a'proper' athlete.

He recently became a qualified Boxing coach thanks to the [Hatton Boxing Academy](http://teamhatton.co.uk).

Training, running, coaching, squash, boxing, cardio, injuries and stuff that helps or gets in the way of those goals.

Enjoy!
