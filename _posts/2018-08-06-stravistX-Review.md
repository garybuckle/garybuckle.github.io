## StravistiX Chrome plugin.

I was wondering recently if I should upgrade to Strava Premium.
> Why would I want to do that with the data that I get from Polar?

Well thats a valid point but the problem with the modern world is that we all belong to various ecosystems.
- FaceBook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
When it comes to health data we may belong to various online services, normally that choice will be dictated by the equipment we use.
- [Polar Flow](https://flow.polar.com)
- [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/)


Importing and exporting data in and out of these sites is sometimes a challenge and linking one service to another might be restricted and clumsy.
There are sites like:
- [Training Peaks](https://www.trainingpeaks.com)
-  [Strava](https://www.strava.com)

So firstly both of these sites have free plans and allow you to bounce or import your fitness results not the sites. The basic plans though donâ€™t really deliver much that will allow you to analyse your performance.
They do offer seemingly comprehensive premium plans that will allow you to do more with the data.

And thats where the article kicks off.

I discovered this:

[StravistiX](%20https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stravistix-for-strava/dhiaggccakkgdfcadnklkbljcgicpckn?utm_source=gmail)

I have just started playing with it but if you feed it your Strava data and some of your biometrics it will start to spit out some interesting data.

The fitness trend graph will give you

- Fitness
- Fatigue
- Form


More to come!
