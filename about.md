This is a simple site, no databases, no logins. 
* All data is stored in a flat file.
* There will be no ‘heavy’ content’
* It wont contain lots of eye candy either.

# This is the start 
In an age where blogs died,
Where hashtags and emojis rule
Where social media outgunned the simple web site.

I made a blog.

Why?

* People like me talk a lot of shit. This is the bucket to hold it.
* I’m genuinely interested in health and fitness and have discovered some useful stuff I’d like to share.

* I’ll collect the data in flat files. What does that mean? - no databases and no data held anywhere that FaceBook, Google, Amazon, or any of the large organisations that run the internet would be interested in

It’s github, place of code. I’m not particularly anti any of these organisations, despite the media uproar. They have their place. I just didn’t want logins et al.

* Having been active for a number of years i was abruptly stopped in my tracks by two detached retinas and my reaction and subsequent attempts to dig myself out have been learning curves.

* Sometimes the internet can be a mine field. I’ll either help to find a way through it or merely add to it.


That’s it really!

It’s that simple!
