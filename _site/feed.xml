&lt;h2 id=&quot;phase-1-training-session&quot;&gt;Phase 1 training session.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a cardio workout with a strong emphasis on the core. Phase 1  sessions   offer a low impact on joints and legs but increase speed, power and strength. The trainer may need some time during the session to demonstrate the correct technique. The goal is to improve fitness while learning the basics of boxing. Learning to box can be considered a skill acquisition and the happiness gained by learning something new.
The aim will be to focus on the technique but allow the student to move along slowly. Perfecting the technique will take time and it will be a lot of fun along the way.
Circuits are a high quality, high octane workout. They should build strength and endurance and can compliment other training programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;duration&quot;&gt;Duration.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 - 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The routine can be a weekly session and you can aim  to move up to Phase 2 within a month but you may also find that Phase 1 is everything you want and remain here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warm-up&quot;&gt;Warm Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 minute head down to feet stretching.
Ensure that no over stretching takes place but that all of the muscles are allowed to stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Any injuries?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Importance of the Stance, fists, distance, pad etiquette - only hit the pad when the pad is facing you, this way the trainer controls the session.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Definition of basic punches. Jab, Cross, Uppercut, Left Hook, Ducking and Weaving, Slipping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All rounds are 3 minutes with a 30 second rest. Some rounds will be sub split into 3 X 1 minute, depending on the activity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Slipping, Ducking and Weaving will strengthen  legs and core, help you to build power when punching.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rotate and  reseting the stance is very important and designed to encourage a proper stance and technique after throwing combinations. This will enhance your session and help prevent any injuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/polar/Sunday Boxing session.png&quot; alt=&quot;HR Data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 minutes of skipping, headphones in and some Cumbia, African or Reggae flooding my brain.
Same routine since I was 14. 
I follow with  6 x 3 minute rounds on a punch bag, 30 seconds rest in between. 
​
Next I do 10 x 1 minute sprints or shuttles. Mostly with a racket in my hand to simulate a squash game.
​
This is mostly a venture out into zone 4 but I like the build up from zones 2 and 3 into zone 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.polar.com/uk-en/support/tips/Polar_Sport_Zones&quot;&gt;Quick intro on zones&lt;/a&gt;
​
I don’t always record the next bits since they are not strictly cardio dependant.
I finish with sit ups and press ups and 3 x 1 minute wall sits ( legs at 90 degree angle, back against the wall)
​
​
Great session and not just for Sundays. In fact I will substitute this routine with a long run if I’m prepping for a marathon.

&lt;p&gt;This is a very basic entry about how logging your fitness sessions can be useful as a motivational tool, sounds very obvious now that I’m writing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of them about and I’ve used a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already stated, there are many options available, some free and some that you have to subscribe to.
The two big sports/fitness manufacturers Garmin and Polar both have very good online facilities and apps for capturing and displaying the data.
Other online portals or tools like &lt;a href=&quot;www.trainingpeaks.com&quot;&gt;Training Peaks&lt;/a&gt; are not free but very useful and comprehensive.I haven’t used Training Peaks but I hear that it’s very in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-log-your-exercises&quot;&gt;Why log your exercises?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you start you will have no idea of where you want to get to and you will not necessarily know where you are. 
You will continually strive to get to where you think you should be but will easily forget where you started.
Some points to remember:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having a visual reminder of your efforts may inspire you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You may become obsessed with logging the workout (it’s a good thing).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can workout effectively and not waste your valuable time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Others will see your efforts and comment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, again I can only offer my experience and my data. It’s one data set and one persons experience so please bear that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience was that logging my workouts initially highlighted how poor my performance was when compared to what it was years ago. Rather than dishearten me though it gave me a ground zero starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting at the bottom gave me a  “I can only get better” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I progressed the progression that I could clearly see was inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends and family who commented on my workouts were encouraging and positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I became very fit, I was able to take rest days in order to prevent burn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became obsessed with logging, it made me get out of bed in the mornings when I envisaged hitting my target of 10 hours of Squash in a given week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence my reward system was sufficiently triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed positive habits in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record I used Garmin and Polar flow, decisions driven by the use of equipment like GPS watches and fitness trackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I’d also used &lt;a href=&quot;www.runkeeper.com&quot;&gt;Runkeeper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I use &lt;a href=&quot;www.&quot;&gt;Polar Flow&lt;/a&gt; and have the account linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/&quot;&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m focusing on Polar because all of the features it offers are essentially free,
_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As long as you have a Polar device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does the Polar Flow service do for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heart Rate- Min, Max and zones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially there isn’t a lot of data to go on so the site or mobile app might look a bit barren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you exercise, the more gets displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a Squash session. I just wanted to post this as an example of the data that these sites provide. I’m planning an entry on the exact usage of HR data and zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/polar/Polar HR Example.png&quot; alt=&quot;HR Data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar also provides a nice visualisation of your sessions all summarised in weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of my April training, slap bang in the middle of my detatched retina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/polar/April Training Diary.png&quot; alt=&quot;April Polar training diary&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the summary tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this with June:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/polar/June Polar training.png&quot; alt=&quot;June Polar training diary&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active people do not react well to doing nothing.
I am no exception but as I sat in the spring sunshine resting and believe me, there was lots of resting. 
I began to contemplate how I could make the best out of the situation. The best out of not doing what I have loved doing for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy answers came first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bits of me that had been complaining about the running and the squash like my left foot, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fasciitis&quot;&gt;Plantar fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, a feature since the Berlin Marathon. After saturday morning pressure sessions with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darrenwithey.co.uk&quot;&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt;.
I would hobble around avoiding puttting pressure on my left foot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My wife would see more of me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I would have time to read more!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wouldn’t have to worry about getting up at 5am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there might be more to it than that.
Surely I could come of this stronger? better? even fitter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sat outside listening to Rich Roll’s Finding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39665673-finding-ultra-revised-and-updated-edition?ac=1&amp;amp;from_search=true&quot;&gt;Ultra&lt;/a&gt; on an Audiobook
I began to wonder if and how I could actually improve from this horrible experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly though, here is the disclaimer :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are people in the world a lot worse off than me!
They don’t sit around complaining and moaning like I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very much inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611735-black-box-thinking&quot;&gt;Black Box Thinking&lt;/a&gt; I began to plot my comeback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-am-i&quot;&gt;Where am I?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a very honest and direct assessment  of my physical condition.
Calorie intake was as high as it had been whilst active. Cut down the calories!
I hadn’t drunk alcohol for 4 months so that was already sorted. My beer drinking data had proven conclusively to me and possibly only applicable to me, that this was a major cause of weight gain. 
What can I do - well that was an easy answer - I couldn’t do anything but I had to make sure that I used the time appropriately and effectively. That meant plotting a course of recovery and not just banging out a 10km run or an intensive boxing session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;visualisation&quot;&gt;Visualisation.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to visualise squash games, I started to visualise positions on court, movement, racket position and mental approaches. I mean what else could I do! I couldn’t actually get in court myself. I spent literally hours thinking about it but not actually doing it.
What an  anorak!!!
I spent a long time reviewing running styles and training sessions. Mentally going through the circuits I could do and when I could do them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-recovery&quot;&gt;The recovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I was able to start doing light exercise.
By the way, do not rely on the doctors or surgeons defining that one for you. As an individual you will have different pain thresholds and different ideas about &lt;em&gt;‘pushing it’&lt;/em&gt; or taking it easy.
For me it had to be very &lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started walking my old running routes and the walks would give me that time to think through stuff, when you’re too busy doing high end cardio you don’t seem to have the time to think though the training.
I measured the walks using my Polar H7 and this was strictly zone 1 and zone 2 territory.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.polar.com/uk-en/support/tips/Polar_Sport_Zones&quot;&gt;Zones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polar.com/blog/running-heart-rate-zones-basics/&quot;&gt;More about Zones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HOW CAN I USE THIS TO IMPROVE MY RUNNING?
Variety is good. Mix different workouts, vary the duration and intensity of your training sessions. Don’t get stuck running the same distance every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Independent article on zones) (http://nataliejohanna.com/blog/2016/6/the-complete-guide-to-heart-rate-training)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you know a bit more about zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started in zone 1 and zone 2 and according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richroll.com/blog/lactate-testing-training-zones/&quot;&gt;Rich Roll&lt;/a&gt; this is not a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advanced-recovery---getting-back-on-the-horse&quot;&gt;Advanced recovery - getting back on the horse.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You may start upping your exercise, nothing extreme though. Nothing that will cause a lot of vibration or pounding, maybe cycling and oh….. don’t worry about the heart rate. Push it a bit if you like”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music to my ears!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I could start some ‘serious’ stuff at last but no pounding or vibration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So running and skipping are out as was squash!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycling it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stationary-cycling-aka-spinning&quot;&gt;Stationary cycling aka Spinning.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built up slowly taking time to sit in the lower zones without worrying about the performance. So back to the point of the blog…. I was training not to measure the performance but more for the actually act of doing it. Something I hadn’t done in a long time. I was learning a lot from this and yes I was also feeling much better about myself. Sitting on the bike, much like walking also helped me think things through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;slow-motion-ghosting&quot;&gt;Slow motion ghosting.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly what is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lancashiresquashandracketball.co.uk/blog/2016/10/20/video-paul-carter-on-ghosting/&quot;&gt;ghosting&lt;/a&gt;. As explained by England coach - Paul Carter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great Nick Mathew:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have two different types of solo practice. One is where I want to do a bit of a physical workout where I’ll do a lot of what’s called ghosting, which is basically movements without the ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had used ‘ghosting; before because it reminds me of shadow boxing. The art of perfecting technique without the pressures of an opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds good but not many outside of top club players and pros use it. It’s not sexy and as exciting as playing, it’s hard work and therefore it doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have no choice though and you are desperate to hold a racket it’s different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deprived of choice I ghosted but very, very slowly!
No bouncing up and down or jerky movements. I watched videos of the pros and did my best, in my own head, in a narrow strip at the side of my house to emulate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving very slowly into position and dragging the racket through the air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pulling out of the shot and recovering smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parallels between  the biomechanics of squash and boxing are very close (doesn’t make me a great player though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case here is the real experience for me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When fit and active I devote very little or no time to technique. I would rather be smashing a ball around the court, running at top speed, punishing the bag and sweating under high end aerobic routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once deprived of the choice I was able to concentrate on improving my game. 
Since starting playing again I have found that my style is a lot smoother. I feel more comfortable and able to recover properly.
Another step to playing proper squash.
All thanks to the injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Things I have learned from injury.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Detached Retina!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/injuries/2018/06/22/Detatched-Retina-recovery-for-Athletes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Detached Retina!" /><published>2018-06-22T11:00:50+01:00</published><updated>2018-06-22T11:00:50+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/injuries/2018/06/22/Detatched%20Retina%20recovery%20for%20Athletes</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/injuries/2018/06/22/Detatched-Retina-recovery-for-Athletes.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;recovering-from-a-detached-retina&quot;&gt;recovering from a detached retina.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was certainly the case for me, coming in a period where I was getting ready for a marathon, challenging in local squash leagues, about to embark on an ultra-marathon and generally enjoying a high level of fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did it happen? - the question everyone asks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of no particular reason why this happened. No squash ball in the eye, no one punched me and I certainly had no trauma that I can recollect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first recollection of anything untoward was having floaters, actually in both eyes.
Floaters are small objects that seem to float in front of the eye, actually thay are inside it and often harmless!
I didn’t expect any issues since my eyesight was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the crash!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis from my first hospital visit was a retinal tear, the treatment for which is laser and fairly standard.
Performed on the same day as my appointment, unfortunately it didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meant I was sent to another hospital for a deeper, more intensive operation to fix the tear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was there that I was informed I had a detached retina.
Initially it’s a bit of a shock since I’d no idea what that actually meant.
In any case the operation consists of laser treatment to ‘weld’ the retina back on to the wall of the eye.
In order to make the operation a success two things happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A gas bubble is inserted into the liquid (vitreous) of the eye.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for 5 days after the operation I had to posture. For 50 minutes of every 60 I had to lie with my head horizontal on the right hand side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not easy but I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One complication I should mention, since if you’ve stayed awake so far  you might as well know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two days I was experiencing pain in my left eye along with headaches, nausea and sickness.
I returned to hospital where after measuring my ocular pressure was told that it was dangerously high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they operated again and removed some of the gas out of the bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All was well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued my recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost two weeks post op, I was told by the surgeon that all looked good and I could resume light exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gas bubble would slowly dissipate and my world would return to pre op status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on Wednesday March the 28th with 6 weeks before my next marathon in Copenhagen I decided to resume light training.
I wasn’t at all sure what that meant or what I wanted to do.
I knew I had to do something!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was our wedding anniversary and my wife and I were going to have a meal together. I was feeling very good, I wanted to do something that made me feel even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, drawing from 40 years of experience I did the thing that linked back to my youth.
Skipping!
20 minutes of jumping rope.
A classic warm up routine back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donning my eye patch safety glasses to avoid the gas bubble from making me nauseous I started the routine.
Headphones on, Reggae and Cumbia washing over me.
Patterns and movements I’d honed over the years feeding my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep it felt great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the session I made my way back into my house and felt the sweat coving my body.
I was back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing the glasses I was greeted with a black screen on my left eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like black sky!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out my eye had haemorrhaged.
The iris flooded with blood, I was blind in my left eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After calls and visits to the hospital it transpired that not only had the eye haemorrhaged but that the retina had also detached once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday the 7th of April I was operated on for a second time.
The result of which was more laser and the insertion of silicon oil in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially the prognosis was very grim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“This might not be the last time we need to operate”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“We cannot guarantee that your retina will not detach again”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Your vision in the left eye may not return to anything like it was previously “&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“You may discover that your running days are over”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not inspiring stuff!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was actually not disheartened by the candid outlook dispensed by the surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later though his diagnosis was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Actually, it’s not bad!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was encouraged by the results.
Despite the blurry vision, a result of dilating eye drops and the Silicon Oil.
I could see through the portal of my left socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from the 7th of April till the 28th I did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No walks, no runs, no squash just nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 days is not long but it was a lifetime to me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add to that the prospect of face down posturing for 50 minutes of every hour for the first 7 days post op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 28th of April I ventured out.
Advice from the surgeon had been to wait until the eye drops were finished and start walking. His advice was to do sports that did not involve rapid movement of the head or heavy vibration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cycling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 3 weeks I started walking and 5 weeks post op, on the 14th of May I started cycling.
On the 25th of May I did 5k on a concept 2 Ergo rowing machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a recipe, a game plan that, touch wood has so far appeared to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will update the post as I progress but as always please consider that all medical conditions are personal and never do anything unless you’ve checked it out with the medical staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday 2018-06-17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an 8 week post op the surgeon has given me the all clear to do exercise.
The two main areas I want to return to being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Running&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Squash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step for the recovery of my retina will be to remove the oil.
After this will be a similar period of rest and taking care as per the last op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind I have decided to let them remove the oil in October/ November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives me time to run my much loved Köln marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m officially starting training for that event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;error message is ‘pairing failed’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context-around-the-issue&quot;&gt;Some context around the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased another Polar device (second Hand). I already own a M400 but the second hand one was a three year old V800 with a gorgeous blue triathlon strap .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I couldnt resist buying it!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When pairing the new device for the first time it was fine.
I had to unpair it because I had it tested by Polar (for free). So in order to (re) pair my old M400 I had to unpair te V800. On receiving the V800 back from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polar.com/uk-en&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt; I had issues pairing with the polar flow app on my iOS device.
Removing it from the account, deleting and reinstalling the Polar Flow app and repairing it from the watch resulted in the pairing error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fix&quot;&gt;The Fix.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you remove the Bluetooth v800 entry under the Bluetooth menu on iOS. 
Otherwise although the device appears to pair, it actually does not pair and will say pairing failed even after entry of the pin&lt;/p&gt;
