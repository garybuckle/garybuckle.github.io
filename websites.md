Basically this page is a placeholder for stuff I've seen on the internet and told everyone I met about.
Months later the most important bits of the message are forgotten and my mantra becomes:

> "What was the title of that post I saw about......."

The first entry has to be [That gut feeling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07ff0hl)

It's a podcast! The importance of the microbiome.

Next up is [Train Ugly](http://trainugly.com)
I love the focus on mindset, growth and learning from failure.

A bit of love to squash fans -   [Squashskills](https://squashskills.com)

Fantastuc site, not free but absolutely crammed with great videos from the game's finest. This is literally and no pun intended, a game changer.


On that note, they do some great articles appropriate for any activity.
[Going with the flow](https://squashskills.com/blog/-/go-with-the-flow/).
An article of when everything just comes together.
