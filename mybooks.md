I have a very amateur interest in sports psychology. So my first entry here has to go to:

[Bounce - Mathew Syed's excellent book on Talent and practice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11398124-bounce). 

You will find all of his books here and Bounce  
is at the bottom. Great place to start.


Second is [Born to run](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7986569-born-to-run)
If you're looking for inspiration then thats definitely a good book to read.
Full of qoutes and facts that will help you as progress along your chosen path to fitness stardom!
[Finding Ultra](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39665673-finding-ultra-revised-and-updated-edition?ac=1&from_search=true)
Rich Roll and his progression from fat to fit....in fact very fit.
