A list of the stuff I have used.

Heart Rate Sensors - Currently my best advice here is the [Polar H10](https://www.polar.com/uk-en/products/accessories//h10_heart_rate_sensor)
I have the H7 but the H10 would be the same..... but better!

I am avoiding reviews since there are so many out there but the one I would place highest is here:
